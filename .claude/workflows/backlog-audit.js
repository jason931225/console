// This one reads the tree as it stands, in chunks a reviewer can actually hold.
//
// THE DISCIPLINE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE, learned the expensive way in this programme:
//   - A finding without file:line evidence is an opinion. It does not become a bead.
//   - An issue is NEVER closed on a guess. "Probably fixed" is not a verdict; the closing comment
//     must name the commit, the test, or the code that makes it moot.
//   - Wrongly closing a real issue is far worse than leaving a stale one open, because the stale one
//     is visible and the closed one is not. When uncertain, the verdict is KEEP with a note.
//   - One writer performs every mutation. Beads and gh are shared state; concurrent writers race.

THE CENSUS THIS RUN COLLECTED (use it to avoid re-filing what is already tracked):
${JSON.stringify(collected).slice(0, 6000)}

WHAT TO HUNT, in descending order of value. These are the classes this programme has actually been
bitten by, so they are worth more than a generic review:

 1. FAIL-OPEN GUARDS. A check that cannot see its subject, or that exits 0 on the empty case. Ask of
    every guard: where does it run in the sequence, does its subject exist yet, and what is the
    finest distinction its data source can express? A census that runs before migrations examines
    zero rows and passes. A per-crate rule enforced by a data source that only distinguishes roles
    never draws the crate boundary.
 2. TENANT AND SCOPE BOUNDARIES. RLS declared but not FORCED; a policy that special-cases one scope
    and leaves the others open; an aggregate that widens visibility by merging sources; a read that
    fails OPEN rather than closed when no org is armed. Note that CURRENT_ORG is a tokio task-local
    and a bare tokio::spawn does not inherit it — that failure returns ZERO ROWS, not an error.
 3. SECOND WRITERS AND DUAL SOURCES OF TRUTH. Two code paths writing one table; a value stored in
    two places that can disagree; a hand-maintained list mirroring something derivable. The canonical
    tables are already gated, so look at the ones that are NOT canonical.
 4. CLAIMS WIDER THAN THE CODE. A doc, comment or test NAME asserting a universal the code does not
    hold — "every", "always", "cannot", "the three ways X can happen". Pick the load-bearing
    assertion, break the code it guards, and say whether it actually goes red.
 5. LABOUR-LAW AND COMPLIANCE GUARDRAILS (§4-31), which are correctness here and not policy taste:
    연차 must have no reason field and cannot be refused (only 시기변경 협의); no overtime glorification;
    no discriminatory recruiting fields; statutory periods and rates must be catalogue-derived with
    the instrument cited, never hardcoded constants.
 6. IRREVERSIBILITY. Hard deletes where the charter requires 보관=숨김; a destructive path reachable
    before dependent objects are settled; an egress that sends before an approval gate.

DO NOT report style, naming, or "consider extracting a helper". Do not report a defect you cannot
demonstrate. An empty findings array from an honest sweep is a GOOD result and must be reported as
one — inventing findings to look productive is the failure mode this phase must avoid.

Before filing anything, check the census for an existing issue or bead covering it and name it in
existingIssue rather than creating a duplicate.

Also report STRENGTHS: controls that are genuinely load-bearing, so a later reader does not simplify
them away. This programme has twice nearly deleted a guard that looked redundant and was not.`,

The worst defects in this programme were never inside one crate. A canonical-writer census sat in a
reconcile script that runs BEFORE migrations, so it examined zero tables and passed in every
automated path. A gate existed, compiled and was tested, and no CI step ever invoked it. A module doc
enumerated "the three ways X can happen" while reviewers had already proven a fourth and a fifth.
Each is a property of the SEAM between things, and no reviewer holding one directory could have found
any of them.

So: read ACROSS. Follow the property wherever it goes. Report the same evidence-bound findings the
per-domain lanes report — file:line, the command, its real output — and mark provenByExecution TRUE
only for what you actually ran.

FOR EACH ISSUE: read it in full (\`gh issue view <n> --comments\`), then go and LOOK at the tree.
The whole point is that issue text describes a repo that has moved on. Decide:

 KEEP            — still a real, open problem. Say what remains true.
 CLOSE-FIXED     — the code now does what the issue asked. EVIDENCE REQUIRED: the commit, the test,
                   or the file:line that implements it. Prefer a merged PR from the census.
 CLOSE-OBSOLETE  — the thing it is about no longer exists, or a decision superseded it. Name the
                   deletion or the ADR.
 CLOSE-DUPLICATE — another issue covers it. Give the number, and prefer keeping the one with more
                   evidence rather than the older one.
 NEEDS-OWNER     — real, but the next step is a human decision, not work. Say what the decision is.

THE BAR FOR CLOSING, and it is deliberately high: a wrongly closed issue is INVISIBLE, while a stale
open one is merely noise. If you cannot point at the thing that makes it moot, the verdict is KEEP
with a staleness note. "Looks done", "probably superseded" and "no longer relevant" are not evidence.

ALSO RECORD STALENESS for KEEP items: what in the issue text is now factually wrong — a renamed file,
a moved line number, a crate that no longer exists, a fixed sub-part. That is what makes an old issue
expensive to pick up, and writing it down is most of the value of this pass.

WITHHELD FOR WANT OF EVIDENCE — these were proposed for closing and must NOT be closed:
${unevidenced.map((v) => `#${v.number} ${v.title || ''}`).join('\n') || '(none)'}

${dead.length ? `LANES THAT NEVER REPORTED — their scope is UNAUDITED and the summary MUST say so: ${dead.join(', ')}` : 'Every read lane reported.'}

DO, in this order:

1. DE-DUPLICATE ACROSS SOURCES before writing anything. The same defect may appear as an audit
   finding, an open issue, and an existing bead. Collapse them and say which record wins. Filing a
   fourth copy of a known problem makes the backlog worse, not better.

2. RANK. Order by severity and blast radius, with proven-by-execution ahead of argued. A tenant or
   money defect outranks a doc drift regardless of how neatly the doc drift is written up.

3. ${APPLY ? 'CREATE BEADS' : 'DRAFT BEADS (do not create — apply is false)'} for confirmed findings.
   Each bead must carry the EVIDENCE inline — file:line, the command, the observed output — so
   nobody re-derives it. A bead whose body is a restatement of its title is worthless six weeks
   later. Set priority from the ranking, and wire dependencies where one finding blocks another.

4. ${APPLY ? 'CLOSE ISSUES' : 'LIST ISSUES TO CLOSE (do not close — apply is false)'} for
   CLOSE-* verdicts that carry real evidence. The closing comment must state WHY, name the commit or
   file that makes it moot, and be written for the person who filed it — this repository's sibling
   project comments an explicit acceptance and then closes with the merged PR named, which is the
   pattern to follow. Never close silently.

5. SYNC THE TWO TRACKERS, and state the rule you applied rather than inventing one per item:
   GitHub issues are the durable, public record; beads are the working queue. So every KEEP issue
   marked beadCandidate should have a bead, and every bead representing work others should see
   should reference an issue. Report the drift you found — this run began with ${issueNumbers.length}
   open issues against a far smaller bead set, which is itself the finding.

6. REPORT: what was filed, what was closed, what was WITHHELD and why, which domains went unaudited,
   and the three things you would fix first. Be honest about coverage — a sweep that missed a domain
   and says so is worth more than one that implies completeness it does not have.`,
