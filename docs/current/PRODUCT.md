# Console product authority

Status: active product authority.

## Product boundary

Console builds one governed company object system in this order:

1. Ontology / Foundry-style object engine and deterministic policy.
2. Company, OrgUnit, JobPosition, Person, and Employment.
3. HR appointment, promotion, and transfer through one canonical assignment writer.
4. Payroll projected from existing payroll truth as PayRun.
5. A Leptos SSR frontend only after every ADR-0030 substrate gate is freshly green.

ERP and finance modules, communications, compliance products, ingest/evidence products, office editing, AI judgment, payment execution, and unrelated verticals are out of scope. Existing code and documents in those areas are historical, quarry, evidence, or maintenance-only; their presence does not authorize expansion.

## Product invariants

- Commands are deterministic and revision-aware, with replay-safe receipts and auditable mutations.
- Tenant isolation, deny-by-omission, and nondisclosure apply at every read and write boundary.
- Effective-dated truth uses half-open intervals; history is closed and appended, never overwritten.
- Projected objects have exactly one domain writer. Ontology and adapters do not create alternate write paths.
- Requester and approver are distinct natural persons for `company.*`, `hr.*`, and `payroll.*` approvals, even when their capacities differ. All other kinds — including `organization.*` and `people.*` — hold only the account-level `approver_id <> requested_by` bar. `requires_natural_person_four_eyes` (`backend/crates/governance/domain`) is prefix-scoped and a test asserts the exclusion. Extending the bar to the remaining kinds is **unscheduled, not blocked**: migration 0076 shows only that `users.employee_id` is nullable, and a NULL resolution can fail closed exactly as the enforced kinds already do. Whether unbound accounts actually exist is an open question no census has answered, so the compatibility risk is a hypothesis on HOLD rather than a reason to leave six of thirteen dispatch targets outside the invariant.
- Preflight uses the same authorization, policy, state, revision, and input validation as execute and performs no mutation.
- Legal sources are versioned evidence, not transferable compliance conclusions. Production exposure and compliance claims require separate authority.

## Architecture

The existing Rust backend is reused as verified substrate rather than rewritten wholesale. The product exposes governed company objects and authorized actions:

`Company → OrgUnit → JobPosition → Person/Employment → HR action → PayRun`

REST and any future server functions are *intended as* sibling adapters over the same application-layer use cases. This is an aspiration, not an enforced boundary: `Layer::allowed_deps` lets `Layer::Rest` reach Adapter, Platform, Domain and Kernel directly, and 6 of 34 REST crates (analytics-quant, consulting, facilities, logistics, orgchange, production) declare no application dependency at all. Converging them is unscheduled work. The frontend, when admitted, reads real contracts, omits unauthorized data server-side, and contains no client-side business authority. Cargo is the target build system; existing Buck paths remain repository reality until a dedicated, evidence-backed convergence change removes them without losing test coverage.

## Holds

- Frontend work is **HOLD** until ADR-0030 gates are freshly green, `Layer::Ui` is accepted, contracts and an SSR shell are stable, and real E2E evidence exists.
- Company, Person, Employment, and PayRun projection fan-out is **HOLD** until each has an explicit owning port and a proven single-writer boundary.
- Live production, DNS, TLS, secret, exposure, payment, credential-reset, and compliance-claim actions are **HOLD** without separate authority and evidence.
- Korea compliance conclusions remain **HOLD** pending qualified authority.
- The grandfathered OCI Ampere A1 instance (4 OCPU / 24 GB) must **never** be destroyed, terminated, resized, or reprovisioned; re-creation permanently loses the reserved capacity.
- Full-disk erase is **HOLD** until the exact Console candidate is durable on reviewed `main` and every irreplaceable local item has either two encrypted off-device copies with manifest/hash read-back and a tested recovery path, or an explicit discard/reissue decision with rotation consequences. This includes signing identity, account recovery and passkeys/2FA, OCI/Talos access, local secret files, restricted business inputs, and unpublished repository/worktree bytes.
- Historical documents, branches, chats, handoffs, and transient runtime state are context or evidence only. They cannot clear these holds; the current handoff may inventory custody evidence without becoming product authority.
