# Agentic engineering playbook

This playbook is subordinate to the pivot, accepted ADRs, roadmap, and development pipeline. It describes repeatable delivery, not product authority.

## Prepare before parallelism
1. Establish a known reference implementation (Company and OrgUnit).
2. Freeze an independently owned behavioral target (`company_conformance`).
3. Publish the mechanical expansion guide (`CATALOG.md`).
4. Run a small JobPosition/projection pilot and prove zero overlapping writes.
5. Preserve and independently verify the test baseline before widening.

## Lane contract
Every admitted lane has parser-visible registry metadata and an additive `docs/program/ledger/<lane-id>.md` receipt: outcome/non-goals, exact base SHA, owner and writable roots, forbidden shared roots, source-of-truth writer, leases, pre-mortem, rollback/stop conditions, immutable test invocation, reviewers, evidence, head SHA, result, HOLDs, and post-merge readback.

Use three writer worktrees, one integration worktree, and one reserve/fix worktree. High-risk authz, migration, contract, HR, release, and compliance-sensitive changes require one implementer, two independent adversarial reviewers, and a distinct integrator. Increase concurrency only after two collision-free epochs; reduce it after collisions, stale-base rebuilds, saturation, or review backlog.

## Evidence and enforcement
Preflight rejects dirty integration roots, stale bases, overlapping ownership, unowned migrations, generated-face writes, and weakened tests. Receipts retain command, revision, lockfile, runtime, counts, failures, and artifact hashes. Dry-run checks prove non-mutation. Jurisdiction records retain source locator, retrieval/effective dates, snapshot hash, applicability, reviewer, evidence links, due date, and claim type; CI never synthesizes a compliance conclusion.

## Task-selected reasoning lifecycle
The canonical vocabulary and routing policy live in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md#task-selected-reasoning-lenses). Apply that policy to every substantive planning, investigation, implementation, review, and verification task, not only to code review.

1. Before acting, classify the task and its risk, then select the smallest useful set of at least two lenses.
2. For high-risk authz, migration, contracts, approval, HR/payroll, release, production, or compliance-sensitive work, include Red Team, Operability / Day-2, Blast-radius / cell-based, and Zero-trust / defense-in-depth, or record a lens-specific not-applicable rationale.
3. Use the selected lenses to guide the work. Re-evaluate the set when evidence, scope, or risk changes.
4. When the task produces a durable governed artifact, persist concise findings, decisions, tradeoffs, exceptions, and lens-set changes in its canonical `lens_contract: v1` evidence block. Record outcomes, not private chain-of-thought.

The policy applies normatively to all substantive tasks. CI can prove only the structure of designated durable records and root manifests; it cannot prove universal task compliance, authentic reasoning quality, or access private reasoning. Historical unmarked ledgers and retrospectives are grandfathered, while new or materially revised governed records use the v1 evidence block.

Continue to review object-first, deep-not-wide, fail-closed authorization, mock-independent behavior, human dignity, and closed-loop rollback. Promote a lesson into `AGENTS.md` only after one severe incident or repeated recurrence; otherwise keep it in retrospectives and this playbook.
