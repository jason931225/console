# CI Gates

Refreshed: 2026-08-17 from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/security.yml`, and root `package.json` on `main` at `7705578e`.

The workflow is the executable inventory. This file is the short, machine-checked mirror. Historical per-gate prose lives in [`docs/program/ci-gates-historical-narrative.md`](program/ci-gates-historical-narrative.md) and may describe deleted surfaces.

Current `main` branch protection requires exactly three GitHub-Actions-app-bound contexts: `Required / CI`, `Required / Security`, and `authenticate-console-authority`.

`npm run check:foundation-gates` machine-checks the two lists below against the workflow and package manifests.

Local verification for a new clone is the sequence in [`docs/current/DELIVERY.md`](current/DELIVERY.md), not a partial subset of the lists above.

## Backend gates

Per-gate essay (historical, possibly stale): [`docs/program/ci-gates-historical-narrative.md`](program/ci-gates-historical-narrative.md).

`console-gate-vendor-lockin` exists under `backend/ci/gates/` and is **not** in the CI-run list above.

### Honest unreachable ADR check

[`ADR-0020`](decisions/ADR-0020-korean-institutional-connectivity-coverage-factory.md) Verification names `check:korean-institutional-connectivity`. That script exists in root `package.json`. No workflow in `.github/workflows/` invokes it as of 2026-08-17. Open PR 796 documents the same fact and deliberately does not delete the script, pending an ADR amendment. The ADR's stated enforcement is currently unreachable. This page does not delete or rewire that gate.

`package.json` still defines other `check:` scripts that no workflow invokes. This inventory lists only scripts `ci.yml` actually runs. Do not treat an unused `check:` name as coverage.
